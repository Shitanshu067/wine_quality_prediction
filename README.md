# wine_quality_prediction
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing features such as acidity levels, residual sugar, alcohol content, pH, etc., as well as the corresponding wine quality ratings.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and get summary statistics.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
Feature Selection and Engineering:

Select relevant features that are likely to influence wine quality.
Create new features if needed, such as combining existing features or extracting useful information.
Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression tasks. Some common algorithms for wine quality prediction include:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks
Model Training: Train the chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate regression evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc., on the testing set.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve its performance.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or unseen data.
